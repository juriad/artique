User can add custom item into application in two ways:
<ul>
	<li>using Manual item dialog,</li>
	<li>via optional extension in common browsers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using dialog</h3>

Dialog for adding a custom item (article) to Manual source can be opened by clicking the plus-sign-shaped icon near manual source or by assigned shortcut.

If the user wants to add a custom item, he must fill following attributes:
<ul>
	<li>URL – URL of the item on Internet.</li>
	<li>Title – title of the item; when the item is shown in the list, the title will be shown as item header.</li>
	<li>Content (optional) – description of the item; when the item is shown in the list, the content will be shown only when the item is selected and expanded.</li>
	<li>Labels – list of labels assigned to the item; if Manual source has some labels to be auto-assigned, these labels will be pre-filled in this list.
		The user is free to remove them.</li>
</ul>
