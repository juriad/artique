<h2>List of items</h2>

<img src="2.png">

List of items is the most important component; it represents potentially infinite list of items which matches currently applied filter.

In the list, at most one item is selected; the selected item can be either expanded or collapsed.
When the item is expanded, its content is shown.

Non-selected items are shown in two styles depending on whether the item is read (bluish background) or unread (bold font).
All non-selected items are automatically collapsed, so their content is hidden.
