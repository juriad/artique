If the source has been already watched by another user, this may take a little longer.

There you can specify a shortcut which adds or removes the label for the selected item.

The last type of shortcuts (filtering items) are defined in Filters.
Go to Filters in left panel and create a new filter.

If you for example want to the key <kbd>u</kbd> to show unread items, leave the filters criteria empty.
Set read state to unread and fill letter <kbd>u</kbd> into the shortcut text box.
The shortcut (and the filter) becomes available as soon as you click Save button in the dialog.
