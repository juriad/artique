That button checks whether that URL is valid.

Once it is, the dialog will expand and allow you to specify its name (required) and some other information.
Click Save to save the source.

In a short time (one minute), the source shall produce new items.
If the source has already been watched by another user, this may take a little longer.

<h3>Creating labels</h3>

A label is created when its name is used for the first time.

Just click plus button on the header of some item; text box will be shown.
In the box write the name of the label and hit <kbd>enter</kbd> key.
A label has been created and you can use it everywhere in the application.

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>

Go to Options in the left panel and open shortcuts editor.
Clicking on Add action shortcut a dialog which allows to create new shortcuts of action type (those which performs an action).
Create shortcuts for those options you think you will use often.

To create another type of shortcuts, those which assigns labels, go to labels editor (also in Options panel).
There you can specify a shortcut which adds or removes the label for the selected item.

The last type of shortcuts (filtering items) is defined in Filters.
Go to Filters in the left panel and create a new filter.

If you for example want to the key <kbd>u</kbd> to show unread items, leave the filter criteria empty.
Set read state to unread and fill letter <kbd>u</kbd> into the shortcut text box.
The shortcut (and the filter) becomes available as soon as you click the Save button in the dialog.
